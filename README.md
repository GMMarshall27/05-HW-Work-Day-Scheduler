# 05-HW-Work-Day-Scheduler

Description:

For this assignment I motified the starter code using bootstrap, jquery, and JS to create a work day scheduler. By doing this I was able to display the correct date, change the text area colors based on the hour of the day, and keep the saved input on the page even after a page refresh. Below you will find the application link and screenshot.
